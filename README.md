# Automatic Python Dependency Checker

*Reza Sameni, Emory University, email: rsameni@dbmi.emory.edu*

Finding the exact library dependencies can be time consuming and challenging when upgrading codebases built with older versions of Python to new versions. We seek to automate this procedure by building a virtual environment and recursively looking for package dependencies that match an incomplete or out-dated requirements file. Read more amout the method by running the Jupyter Notebook [testCompatibilityChecker](testCompatibilityChecker.ipynb).
