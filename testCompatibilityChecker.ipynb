    "The Compatibility Checker is a tool that helps you manage and upgrade Python dependencies for your projects. It ensures that your project dependencies are compatible with each other and provides an easy way to upgrade them. It creates a sandbox-like virtual environmnet to test the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the Compatibility Checker, make sure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system. You can download and install Anaconda from the official Anaconda website: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to set up the Compatibility Checker:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the [Compatibility Checker Github repository](https://github.com/rsameni/python-dependency-checker.git) in a directory of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Compatibility Checker, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Launch your Jupyter notebook or any Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import the CompatibilityChecker class:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from compatibility_checker import CompatibilityChecker\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an instance of the CompatibilityChecker:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   checker = CompatibilityChecker()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Set the paths and parameters for the CompatibilityChecker instance. Update the paths according to your setup or replace by absolute paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "checker.requirements_old_file = os.path.join(root_path, 'requirements_old.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `requirements_old_file`: The path to the requirements file (in `txt` format) that contains the old or existing dependencies. It specifies the dependencies and their versions to be upgraded.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "checker.requirements_new_file = os.path.join(root_path, 'requirements_new.txt')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `requirements_new_file`: The path to the requirements file (in `txt` format) that will be generated after upgrading the dependencies. It will contain the upgraded dependencies and their versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "checker.code_file = os.path.join(root_path, 'test.py')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `code_file`: The path to the Python code file that you want to run after upgrading the dependencies. This file can utilize the upgraded dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "checker.data_path = os.path.join(root_path, 'path/to/data/data')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `data_path`: The path to the directory or folder that contains any data files or resources that your code may require. This path can be used within your code to access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "checker.venv_name = 'compatibility_checker_venv'\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `venv_name`: The name of the virtual environment (venv) that will be created to isolate the upgraded dependencies. The venv provides an isolated environment to run your code with upgraded dependencies without affecting the system-wide Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters allow you to specify the file paths, venv name, and data path necessary for the compatibility checking and code execution process. Adjust the `root_path` variable to the desired root directory path in order to construct the complete file paths for each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   root_path = '/path/to/compatibility_checker/'\n",
    "\n",
    "   checker.requirements_old_file = root_path + 'requirements_old.txt'\n",
    "   checker.requirements_new_file = root_path + 'requirements_new.txt'\n",
    "   checker.code_file = root_path + 'test.py'\n",
    "   checker.data_path = root_path + 'data'\n",
    "   checker.venv_name = 'compatibility_checker_venv'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Upgrade the dependencies and generate the `requirements_new.txt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   checker.upgrade_dependencies()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will create or update a virtual environment named `compatibility_checker_venv` with the required Python version and install/upgraded the dependencies listed in the `requirements_old.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Run your test code or application using the updated dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   subprocess.run(['python', checker.code_file], check=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Replace `checker.code_file` with the path to your actual code file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Updating Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the dependencies for your project, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the `requirements_old.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add or modify the dependency lines in the file. Each line should follow the format: `<library_name><version_specification>`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python_version=3.9\n",
    "   numpy>=1.19.2\n",
    "   pandas==1.2.3\n",
    "   matplotlib>=3.2.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The first line should also have the base Python version. Save the file after making the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the Compatibility Checker again using the steps mentioned in the \"Usage\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The Compatibility Checker will update the virtual environment with the new dependencies and generate an updated `requirements_new.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Managing Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "The Compatibility Checker creates a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies for your project. You can manage the virtual environment using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Activate the virtual environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  conda activate compatibility_checker_venv\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deactivate the virtual environment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  conda deactivate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Compatibility Checker simplifies the management of Python dependencies for your projects. By using this tool, you can ensure that your dependencies are up to date and compatible, reducing compatibility issues and improving the overall stability of your project. Check the full example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TODO\n",
    "- Modify to work with more sophisticated formats of the requirements text file\n",
    "- Make the code compatible with non-Conda package management\n",
    "- Integrate the package installation with running the test.py code\n",
    "- Add an input flag option that asks to remove an existing venv that has a similar name\n",
    "- data_path is not currently used. Pass it to the test function if needed."
